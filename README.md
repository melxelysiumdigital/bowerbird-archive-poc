# Bowerbird Archive POC

Monorepo for the Bowerbird Archive proof of concept — a Next.js website, Shopify embedded app, and Shopify theme with a shared component library.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 25
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) 9.15.0

## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Scripts

### Development

```bash
# Start all apps in dev mode
pnpm dev

# Start individual apps
pnpm dev:web
pnpm dev:shopify-app
pnpm dev:shopify-theme
```

The Shopify theme has a two-process dev workflow:

```bash
cd apps/shopify-theme

# Terminal 1 — Vite watches and rebuilds TS/CSS into theme/assets/
pnpm dev

# Terminal 2 — Shopify CLI serves the theme
pnpm theme:dev
```

### Build & Validate

```bash
pnpm build          # Build all workspaces
pnpm type-check     # TypeScript check across all workspaces
pnpm lint           # ESLint across all workspaces
pnpm lint:fix       # Auto-fix lint issues
pnpm format:check   # Check Prettier formatting
pnpm format         # Auto-format all files
```

### Cleanup

```bash
pnpm clean          # Remove build artifacts and node_modules
```

## Adding shadcn/ui Components

Components are installed into `packages/ui/src/components/` and shared across all apps. Always run the CLI from an app directory:

```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add dialog
```

The CLI reads the app's `components.json`, which points component output to `packages/ui`. After adding, import from any app:

```tsx
import { Dialog } from '@bowerbird-poc/ui/components/dialog';
```

App-specific composed components should live in each app's own `components/` directory.

## Tailwind CSS

Tailwind v4 is configured with a single source of truth at `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`. This file uses `@source` directives to scan all apps for class usage.

Each app's CSS simply imports the shared styles:

```css
@import '@bowerbird-poc/ui/globals.css';
```

## Shopify Theme

The theme at `apps/shopify-theme/theme/` is based on [Dawn](https://github.com/Shopify/dawn) (Shopify's reference theme) with React component support via Vite. It follows the standard Shopify directory structure (layout, sections, snippets, templates, config, locales, assets).

Vite compiles `src/entries/*.ts` and `src/entries/*.css` into `theme/assets/` with stable filenames (`react.bundle.js`, `react.min.css`, `theme.bundle.js`, `theme.min.css`). These build outputs are **gitignored** and generated by CI — they should never be committed.

```bash
cd apps/shopify-theme

pnpm theme:push     # Push theme to Shopify
pnpm theme:pull     # Pull theme from Shopify
```

The theme uses `@bowerbird-poc/ui` React components (HeroBanner, ProductCard) mounted via a Liquid snippet system, and `@bowerbird-poc/shared` for utilities.

## Deployment

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) handles theme deployment:

1. Builds the full monorepo (`pnpm build`) — generates Vite assets
2. Syncs only the `theme/` directory (respecting `.shopifyignore`) to a deployment branch
3. Pushes to `deploy/shopify-test` (on merge to main) or `deploy/shopify-prod` (manual dispatch)

Deployment branches contain only Shopify-ready theme files — no source code, node_modules, or build tooling. Connect the deploy branch to Shopify's GitHub integration for automatic theme updates.

Manual deployment via workflow dispatch supports `test`, `production`, and `custom` branch targets.

### Non-destructive sync

Deploys preserve changes made through the Shopify admin (template customizations, theme settings). The workflow uses a two-pass rsync instead of a full branch replacement:

| Category | Behavior | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Fully synced** (old files cleaned up) | Overwritten every deploy | `assets/`, `sections/`, `snippets/`, `layout/`, `locales/`, `config/settings_schema.json` |
| **New only** (never overwritten) | Repo templates are copied on first deploy; Shopify admin edits are preserved on subsequent deploys | `templates/**` |
| **Excluded entirely** | Never touched by deploys; managed only via Shopify admin | `config/settings_data.json` |

This means you can safely customize templates and theme settings in the Shopify admin without losing them on the next deploy.
